# FILELESS UAC BYPASS USING COMPMGMTLAUNCHER.EXE


## Information

    Similar to the “eventvwr.exe” bypass, “CompMgmtLauncher.exe” checks for 
    the existence of a default HKCU\Software\Classes\mscfile\shell\open\command value, 
    if it doesn’t find it, it checks for the same in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and would typically 
    launch mmc.exe and in turn the Computer Management Console. 
    Since CompMgmtLauncher.exe’s first check in the registry for that key/value in 
    the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive results in a “NAME NOT FOUND” (when investigating with procmon), 
    we can add those missing keys/value to launch a binary (along with parameters) of our choosing 
    essentially hijacking “CompMgmtLauncher.exe”‘s execution flow.  
    
#Severity ::: Medium

## Tested on ::: 
    Windows 7. Might work on 8, might work on 10, haven’t tried yet!
## NOTE :::
    The above PoC assumes you have a shell on a machine and your current user is an admin 
    with UAC enabled to anything other than “Always Notify”. This isn’t a privilege escalation 
    vulnerability, it’s a UAC Bypass 
    Remember to clean up so everything works “as normal” after you’ve run your code:
        reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\mscfile /f
