# CVE-2017-8759

I just tried to implement this amazing exploit inititally by Voulnet & bhdresh.

I/these guys mentioned above wont be responsilbe for any cause you does with these codes :)

## Weponization Vectors:
  
  * Via Expire, well this is not fully Automated. After generation of rtf and wsdl, you got to upload
    wsdl and also got to mention url of wsdl while generation.
    
  * Via C# DLL. this one is pretty straightforward. this exploit binds your whole dll into one wsdl
    which you got to host somewhere and mention that url inside generator.


#### NOTE : Empire Vector isn't tested :)
